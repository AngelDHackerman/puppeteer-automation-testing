  <summary><h1>Test Plan for DemoQA</h1></summary>

  **Objective:** The objective of this test plan is to validate the functionality and usability of the interactive elements on the QA demonstration webpage.

**Scope:** This test plan covers the following elements on the webpage:

- Elements
- Forms
- Alerts, Frame & Windows
- Widgets
- Interactions
- Book Store Application

**Approach:** Each of the above elements will be tested individually to ensure they function as expected. Automated tests using Puppeteer will be used to simulate user interaction with these elements, using desktop and mobile views.

**Test Strategy:**

1. **Elements:** Verify that all elements (buttons, text boxes, etc.) load correctly and respond to user interaction as expected.
2. **Forms:** Verify that forms accept user input and process it correctly. This includes input validation and verifying that success/error messages are displayed correctly.
3. **Alerts, Frame & Windows:** Verify that alerts display correctly and that frames and windows load and function as expected.
4. **Widgets:** Verify that widgets load correctly and function as expected.
5. **Interactions:** Verify that interactions (such as drag and drop) function correctly.
6. **Book Store Application:** Verify that the bookstore application loads correctly, that all links and buttons function as expected, and that the shopping cart functionality works correctly.

**Success Criteria:** Each of the above elements should function as expected with no errors. Any deviation from expected functionality will be considered a test failure.

**Schedule:** The tests will be performed in the following order: Elements, Forms, Alerts, Frame & Windows, Widgets, Interactions, Book Store Application. Each set of tests will be performed in a separate session to avoid interference between tests.

**Resources:** The tests will be performed using Puppeteer to automate user interactions. **A development environment with Node.js and Puppeteer installed will be required.**

**Risks:** The main risks to this test plan are changes to the QA demonstration webpage that could cause tests to fail. To mitigate this risk, the webpage will be reviewed before each test session to identify any changes that could affect the tests.
